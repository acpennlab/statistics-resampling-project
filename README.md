# statistics-resampling-online

Try the statistics-resampling package online in a Notebook with an Octave kernel within Jupyter Lab using Binder by clicking the launch-binder button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?labpath=statistics-resampling.ipynb)

Note that the first time you access statistics-resampling online (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it may take a while to build, but frequent access to statistics-resampling-online thereon should give load times less than a minute. Data files (.tsv and .csv) can be conveniently modified using the [jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor.html) included in this environment. The environment also includes kernels to run workbooks in R and Python (in which additional packages and modules can be installed from CRAN and with pip respectively, or [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/packages/)). You could also consider loading Jupyter notebooks and data files from your own GitHub repositories using this Binder environment with the help of the [nbgitpuller link generator](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html?tab=binder). This Binder repository is `nbgitpuller` enabled, so you can use it's environment (and it's image if it exists already) to load content (e.g. notebooks and data) from your own GitHub repository.

The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found [here](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/index.html). If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/).
